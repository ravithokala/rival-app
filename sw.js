 * Saves the app's own files, so the app opens at once and with no connection. The data is not

 * sign-in) go to the network.
 * Only this top part is the app's own; the logic below the marker line comes from app-kit.
 * - VERSION: leave as it is. Publishing (scripts/deploy-pwa.sh) replaces it in the published copy
 *   with the commit and a hash of every file, so any change is a new release.
 * - SHELL: every file of the app (tests/pwa.test.js checks it).
 * - LEGACY: names of older saved copies to delete (none for this app; kept as the other apps have it).

// A release opens from its own saved copy, filled completely when this worker installs, so the app
// starts at once: with no connection, and also when connected with no internet behind it (mobile
// data used up), where a request would hang rather than fail. It does not wait for the site on
// every open. Only the release check (version.js with a query) goes to the network: it is how the
// page notices a newer release, which installs a new worker and a new saved copy before the page
// reloads (pwa/update.js, or the app's own code). The data is never saved here.
// The design is the Property Portfolio's (2026-09), used by all three apps since 2026-10-02.
